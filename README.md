# BLS aggregator for multi-signature wallets

## Summary
A set of smart contracts to bring lower gas costs for **multi-sig wallets** to EVM rollups via aggregated BLS signatures.

## Description

If you have used a multisig wallet, you might have probably noticed the higher gas fees that you paid in comparison to a regular EOA. We have created a set of smart contracts that implements a BLS-based signature aggregator, to validate aggregated signatures of multisig wallets.
